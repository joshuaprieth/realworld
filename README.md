This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[YOUR_FRAMEWORK]** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[YOUR_FRAMEWORK]** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

**A training project to polish up my Rust skills again. Just the backend of realworld is implemented.**

# Getting started

`cargo run`
